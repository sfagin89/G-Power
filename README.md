# G-Power

A custom PACMAN application using QT, using a gesture sensor to control the movements of the player character with hand motions.

### Implemented or Desired Features
- [x] Automatically exit game on win or loss
- [x] Freeze ghosts when cherry is eaten
- [ ] Multiple levels with increased difficulty
- [ ] Change 'theme' of ghosts and player character

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Required:
  - 1x  Beaglebone Black running a linux distro
  - 1x APDS-9960 RGB and Gesture Sensor
  - 1x Pushbutton Switch
  - 1x 330Î© Resistor
  - 1x Breadboard (Optional)

### Software Required:
  - ARM compiler

## Steps to Run from a Beaglebone Black:

1. Download and unzip the G-Power repo

2. From inside the APDS9960_BeagleBone directory, run `make` to produce the gesture controller binary.

3. From inside the pacman-milestone directory, run `qmake` then `make` to produce the QT binary.
  *IMPORTANT: If you're going to run the game as a user other than root, open the mainwindow.cpp file and change the file paths at line 18 & 96 to your home directory.

You should have two binaries now, APDS9960_i2c_BBB & Gpower

4. Move both binaries to your home directory on the BeagleBone Black

*IMPORTANT: You may need to change the permission level of the binary files using the `chmod` command before you can execute them.

5. Run the Gpower binary in the background using the command: `./Gpower &``

6. Run the APDS9960_i2c_BBB binary using the command `./APDS9960_i2c_BBB`
